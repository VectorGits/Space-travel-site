  The terminology...
  Launch vehicle

  A launch vehicle or carrier rocket is a rocket-propelled vehicle used to carry a 
  payload from Earth's surface to space, usually to Earth orbit or beyond. Our 
  WEB-X carrier rocket is the most powerful in operation. Standing 150 metres tall, 
  it's quite an awe-inspiring sight on the launch pad!

  A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry 
    capsule to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where 
    you'll spend your time during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, 
    and plenty of other activities to keep you entertained.
