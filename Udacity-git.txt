What does git show do?
The git show command will show only one commit. So don't get alarmed when you can't find any other commits - it only shows one. The output of the git show command is exactly the same as the git log -p command. So by default, git show displays:

the commit
the author
the date
the commit message
the patch information
However, git show can be combined with most of the other flags we've looked at:

--stat - to show the how many files were changed and the number of lines that were added/removed
-p or --patch - this the default, but if --stat is used, the patch won't display, so pass -p to add it again
-w - to ignore changes to whitespace
